<!--

The px-app-route component relies on the Polymer team's [app-location](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-route)
element to manage the window location and history state. The element will consume
the `route` provided by app-location and send updates to other components
on the page when the URL changes. Interaction with other components on the page
will be propagated up to the URL using the same bindings.

### Installing and including in an app

The px-app-route element is included as part of the [px-app-helpers](https://github.com/PredixDev/px-app-helpers) package.
To install the element using bower, use the following command:

    bower install --save px-app-helpers

After installing, import the code using HTML imports into the app file that
implements px-app-helpers. You'll also need to import app-location from the
Polymer team's app-route package.

    <link rel="import" href="/bower_components/app-route/app-location.html"/>
    <link rel="import" href="/bower_components/px-app-helpers/px-app-route/px-app-route.html"/>

The app-route package will be installed automatically when px-app-helpers
is included in your bower file.

### Using px-app-route

The following simplified example shows how px-app-route can be used to send
updates to the [px-app-nav](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/components/px-app-nav/)
element when the URL changes, and update the URL when the navigation is
interacted with:

    <app-location route="{{route}}" use-hash-as-path></app-location>
    <px-app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        use-hash-as-path
        update-nav-route
        nav-route="{{navRoute}}">
    </px-app-route>
    <px-app-nav
        items="{{navItems}}"
        selected-route="{{navRoute}}">
    </px-app-nav>

If the following `navItems` are defined:

    [
      {
        "id" : "home",
        "label" : "Home"
      },
      {
        "id" : "dashboards",
        "label" : "Dashboards",
        "children" : [
          {
            "id" : "a1",
            "label" : "Alerts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

Then tapping on the 'Alerts' navigation button will change the URL to
"example.com/#/dashboards/alerts". Bookmarking that URL and loading
it again later will automatically select the 'Alerts' navigation item
on page load.

### Complex routing: navigation and assets

Many complex applications require the user the navigate to a view (like the
'Alerts' dashboard view in the example above) and provide some additional
information about the kind of asset or context they would like to view.
The [px-context-browser](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/components/px-context-browser/)
and [px-breadcrumbs](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/components/px-breadcrumbs/)
elements both help the user select the specific asset they would like to view.

The px-app-route element supports binding to the navigation to allow users to
navigate to purpose-driven views, and binding to multiple asset browsing elements
to update whats visible within the view.

The following example shows all of these elements working together:

    <app-location route="{{route}}" use-hash-as-path></app-location>
    <px-app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        use-hash-as-path
        update-nav-route
        nav-route="{{navRoute}}">
    </px-app-route>
    <px-app-nav
        items="{{navItems}}"
        selected-route="{{navRoute}}">
    </px-app-nav>
    <px-context-browser
        items="{{assetItems}}"
        selected-route="{{assetRoute}}">
    </px-context-browser>
    <px-breadcrumbs
        items="{{assetItems}}"
        selected-route="{{assetRoute}}">
    </px-breadcrumbs>

If the following `navItems` are defined:

    [
      {
        "id" : "home",
        "label" : "Home"
      },
      {
        "id" : "dashboards",
        "label" : "Dashboards",
        "children" : [
          {
            "id" : "a1",
            "label" : "Alerts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

And the following `assetItems` are defined:

    [
      {
        "id" : "us",
        "label" : "United States",
        "children" : [
          {
            "id" : "calif",
            "label" : "California",
            "children" : [
              {
                "id" : "bay-area",
                "label" : "San Francisco Bay Area"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

If the user selects the "Alerts" view and uses the context browser to choose
"San Francisco Bay Area" as a filter for the visible alerts, the URL will
be changed to the following: "example.com/#/dashboards/alerts~/us/calif/bay-area"

### Changing the way URLs are built

The URL path produced by px-app-route can be bound to two models: the navigation
model (through `navRoute`) and the asset model (through `assetRoute`). Depending
on the needs of the web app, one or both models can be bound to.

The selected item in each model can be represented as:

  - a **route**, an array of unique ID strings that start at the root of the model
  graph and terminate at the selected item (e.g. `["us", "calif", "bay-area"]`).
  - a **path**, a stringified representation of the route that can be used to
  set the URL path (e.g. "us/calif/bay-area")

By default, the route segments are joined together with the '/' character, but
that can be changed:

    <app-location route="{{route}}" use-hash-as-path></app-location>
    <px-app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        use-hash-as-path
        update-nav-route
        nav-route="{{navRoute}}"
        segment-paths-with=".">
    </px-app-route>

In the above example, the navigation model route `["us", "calif", "bay-area"]`
would be transformed into the path string "us.calif.bay-area".

Choose a safe, unreserved URI character to ensure there are no issues setting
URL path or loading it later. See [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)
for a list of unsafe and reserved characters. In general, use one of: `-`, `.`,
`_`, or `~`. The chosen character should not appear in any of the unique ID
strings in the model route.

When two models are used, the models must be joined together with a character
to divide the two paths. By default, the models are joined with the '~'
character. Set the `segment-models-with` attribute on the px-app-route element
to a safe, unreserved URI character to change this.

### Routing with hash

When the backend application server is not setup to manage routes and send frontend
routes to a single-page web app index file the hash portion of the URL can be
used to do routing. To enable hash-based URLs, enable the `use-hash-as-path`
attribute on both the px-app-route element and the app-location element that
produces the route.

### Integrating px-app-route with other routers

The `encodeAllPaths`, `encodePath`, and `decodePath` methods available on all
px-app-route instances can also be called directly without stamping a
px-app-route element in your app.

Those methods are available at `window.PxApp.RouteHelpers.[METHOD_NAME]`.
Calling these methods directly on the window is a useful way to encode and
decode model routes on your page and send the result to a third-party router
(e.g. any Angular or React router).

See the API documentation for this component for more information on how
to use the static methods to encode and decode model routes/paths.

       * ## Configuring segment seperators
       *
       * The characters used to seperate segments of each path, and the character
       * used to join multiple model paths, can be set through the options
       * object to any URI-safe character (one of `-`, `.`, `_`, or `~`).
       *
       * To decode this custom path, use the following options:
       *
       * ```
       *   decodePath('alerts.inbox_factories.factory1.area38', {
       *     navRoute: true,
       *     assetRoute: true,
       *     segmentPathsWith: '.',
       *     segmentModelsWith: '_'
       *   });
       * ```
       *
       * The following object will be returned:
       *
       * ```
       *   {
       *     navRoute: ['alerts', 'inbox'],
       *     assetRoute: ['factories', 'factory1', 'area38']
       *   }
       * ```
       *
       * ## All configurations
       *
       * The following `options` can be passed to change the output:
       *
       *   - `navRoute`: A boolean, if `true` the nav route will be decoded
       *   - `assetRoute`: A boolean, if `true` the asset route will be decoded
       *   - `segmentPathsWith`: Any URI-safe character (one of `-`, `.`, `_`, or `~`)
       *   - `segmentModelsWith`: Any URI-safe character (one of `-`, `.`, `_`, or `~`)
       *   - `stripPrefix`: Strips the `segmentPathsWith` character from the front of the path, if it is found there
       *
       * @param  {String} path
       * @param  {Object} options
       * @return {Object}
