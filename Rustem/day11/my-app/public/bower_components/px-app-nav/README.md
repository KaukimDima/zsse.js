# px-app-nav
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PredixDev/px-app-nav.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PredixDev/px-app-nav)

Px-app-nav is a Predix UI component which can be used as a navigation bar or as a drawer for applications.

## Overview

Use `px-app-nav` to cleanly navigate portions or pages of a application. The navigation can be minimized or expanded to reveal the navigation items, which can have sub-items. The navigation can host other web components or authentication such as the px-login web component. Navigation items can use icons to better communicate with the user.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. node.js
2. npm
3. bower
4. Install the [webcomponents-lite.js polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) to add support for web components and custom elements to your application.

### Getting Started
